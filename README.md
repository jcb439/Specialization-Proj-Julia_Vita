## How We Built This Website

### Development Process

Our website evolved iteratively throughout the semester, with each page corresponding to a specific assignment or milestone:

1. **Initial Development** (September-November 2025)
   - Created individual pages for each assignment as they were completed
   - Updated pages after each critique session based on feedback

2. **Post-Final Restructuring** (December 2025)
   - Reorganized navigation into two clear sections: **Research** and **Prototyping**
   - Adjusted and added content for final review feedback
