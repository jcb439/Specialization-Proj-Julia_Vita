            <p><strong>Market Research & Gap Analysis</strong></p>
            <p>Survey existing products, services, and policy incentives to map the current landscape of sustainability engagement. Particular attention is given to identifying the <em>"middle space"</em>—opportunities that bridge large-scale financial frameworks and small, altruistic individual habits.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Prototyping</strong></p>
            <p>Develop early-stage prototypes that experiment with ways to make everyday actions visible, meaningful, and politically powerful. These prototypes function both as design interventions and as tools for surfacing new incentive structures.</p>
            
            <p><strong>User Testing & Ethnography</strong></p>
            <p>Engage with individuals and communities through observation, interviews, and ethnographic methods to understand how prototypes integrate into daily practices. This helps reveal how people perceive sustainability incentives when framed beyond top-down policies or isolated habits.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Iteration</strong></p>
            <p>Continuously refine prototypes through cycles of testing and feedback. Each iteration integrates user insights, ensuring that interventions remain responsive to real practices while keeping focus on linking micro-actions with broader systemic change.</p>
