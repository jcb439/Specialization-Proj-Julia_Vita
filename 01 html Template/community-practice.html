                <p>Research across design, sociology, and environmental studies shows that environmental participation often takes shape through everyday practices rather than big declarations. What counts as care is being redefined in small but politically meaningful acts that gain significance when enacted through material practices rather than verbal commitments alone.</p>
                <p><strong>Given this, we aim to explore ways of incentivizing individual actions that advance sustainability within the “middle space” — bridging large-scale, financially driven frameworks and isolated, altruistic habits.</strong></p>
            <div class="section-box">
                <div class="section-title">Everyday Material Practices Matter</div>
                <p>Repair, composting, food sharing, and gardening are powerful ways people express environmental care beyond words. For example, community composting in New York City connects household waste practices to broader urban systems (Morrow & Davies, 2021).</p>

                <div class="section-title">Invisible Political Acts Can Be Politically Powerful</div>
                <p>Minimal, everyday gestures—such as cleaning, healing, or maintaining domestic spaces—are often overlooked but carry transformative significance in sustaining life in toxic environments (Tironi, 2018; Ourabah, 2025).</p>

                <div class="section-title">Connecting Individuals to Systems</div>
                <p>Citizen sensing projects, such as DIY air pollution monitoring, demonstrate how local data collection can influence policy and infrastructure, making small gestures part of systemic change (Gabrys, 2017; Knox, 2021).</p>

                <div class="section-title">Frameworks of Care</div>
                <p>Much of this work draws on the ethics of care and more-than-human approaches, emphasizing interdependence across people, communities, and environments (Sovová et al., 2021).</p>

                <div class="section-title">Sustaining Participation</div>
                <p>Research suggests that reflection, community networks, and skill-sharing are key to keeping care practices alive. While financial incentives play a role, cultural recognition of "unspoken" acts like repair, reuse, and composting may be just as important (Isenhour & Reno, 2019; Graziano & Trogal, 2017; Young & Rosner, 2018).</p>
