                <p>...recognize genuine environmental care through everyday actions, not just words?</p>
                <p>...reframe material practices—repairing, gardening, swapping, sharing—as civic participation equal to voting or protesting?</p>
                <p>...surface contradictions between what people say and what they do, in ways that invite reflection rather than blame?</p>
                <p>...build infrastructures where communities see themselves not as consumers, but as active participants shaping the future?</p>

                <p>• <strong>Recognition</strong> (care in action)</p>
                <p>• <strong>Reframing</strong> (everyday practices as political)</p>
                <p>• <strong>Reflection</strong> (contradictions without shame)</p>
                <p>• <strong>Infrastructure</strong> (bigger system for participation)</p>

                <div class="section-title">Expanding Directions:</div>
                <p>→ Prototype a system that measures environmental participation through <em>repair, reuse, sharing, and redistribution</em> at community scale.</p>
                <p>→ A platform that documents environmental gestures that often go unnoticed (fixing, composting, cycling, lending tools).</p>
                <p>→ Prototype a digital infrastructure where <em>practice outweighs slogans</em> — mapping how communities act on their values (what are the learnings from individual actions?).</p>
                <p>→ Prototype a registry that treats material practices (gardening, repairing, swapping) as <em>political acts</em> equal to voting or protesting.</p>
                <p>→ Prototype a tool that reveals gaps between what people/organizations <em>say</em> and what they <em>do</em> environmentally — but without judgment, as a space for reflection.</p>
